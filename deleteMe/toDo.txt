material:

. Students could find study resources and teaching materials here, but it would be more flexible than Fronter; students could look for fellows with the same interests/focus, but it would be more professional than Facebook; students could ask academic questions and get instant answer, but it would be more precise and tailored than what google provides; students could read about much insights in each study field like in many other specialty forums, but they only need one login to have access to them all.
