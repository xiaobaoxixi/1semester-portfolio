                <h3>How we found our mission, vision, value and goal</h3>
                <p>In the ideation week, we discussed a lot of ideas, big or small, about a wide range of topics, from grocery shopping to investment in Startups, from cafe shops in the neighbourhood to cyber identity that’s beyond the border of a traditional society. We have ideas that are based on our needs in today’s life. We also have ideas that express our dreams and wishes for the future. We are willing to do a lot and we have some knowledge in certain fields already. But it’s not enough. Then we realised that what we essentially need, as students, is a network that can unite us all; a platform where we can share knowledge and teach each other more; a stage that’s for showcasing individual skillset and thereafter effectively bridge every possible collaboration and cooperation to make us even wiser and stronger. In order to be able to focus more on study and unfolding our full potential, we need as well a community where we help and support each other by sharing information and making day-to-day student life much easier. </p>
                <p>The current situation is that there are a lot of platforms, services and SoMe solutions out there already, and we, as students, use them all. A conclusion might be drawn here that we already have plenty and we don’t need another one. Yet let’s look at this situation again and think in another way: we use them all, because none of the existing platforms is dedicated to students and targeting students’ needs. We use them all, because we have to do so, and even with all of them, we still get lost every now and then, here and there.</p>
                <p>So we decided to build a Student Hub, the reservoir and ever refreshing source of everything that’s student-life related. Students could find study resources and teaching materials here, but it would be more flexible than Fronter; students could look for fellows with the same interests/focus, but it would be more professional than Facebook; students could ask academic questions and get instant answer, but it would be more precise and tailored than what google provides; students could read about much insights in each study field like in many other specialty forums, but they only need one login to have access to them all. </p>

                <h3>The form of Student Hub</h3>
                <p>.. would be a combination of an online archive, a forum and a community media. Because it hosts many different sections, some of which have focus on providing accurate information for users to receive, while others rely on active user input, user interaction even co-creation, we would fine-tune each section and find the appropriate solution for the particular case, which will be discussed below.</p>

                <h3>We believe in</h3>
                <p>.. sharing as the way to develop and advance. We value original work and open discussion.</p>
                <p>We meet the existing needs from students, and we built the bridge that opens up even more opportunities. We would like that whenever a student needs anything, he or she reaches out to the Student Hub. </p>
